# COLLECTION TWO

Card.create(image: 'http://localhost:3000/Rodarte_2.jpg', likes: 0, details: 'As frothy as the Rodarte aesthetic can be, it is quite durable in its own way.

# COLLECTION 3
Card.create(image: 'http://localhost:3000/McQueen_1.jpg', likes: 0, details: 'The voices of women deserve a far bigger hearing—in fashion, as in life. Sarah Burton holds that feeling to heart in a way that strives to connect deep history—eons of it—with the present.', collection_id: 3)

Card.create(image: 'http://localhost:3000/McQueen_2.jpg', likes: 0, details: 'This collection was, she said, “about sisterhood, about women’s milestones and rituals: birth, christenings, weddings, funerals.

Card.create(image: 'http://localhost:3000/McQueen_3.jpg', likes: 0, details: 'To find tactile, experiential inspiration for the rest, Burton had led her team out of the enormous new plate-glass offices of Alexander McQueen in London and taken them to see what they saw and felt among the ancient monuments of the English West Country. The flowers—painted, printed, and jacquard-ed—were, she said, from the photographs they took of the hedgerows on the Somerset marshes, where Arthurian legends were supposedly set.', collection_id: 3)

Card.create(image: 'http://localhost:3000/Dries_3.jpg', likes: 0, details: 'In Van Noten’s much more practiced, grown-up hands, the gestures were about draping and tying, using papery-light technical fabric. There was a flower-printed side-draped skirt with a kind of half train, worn with a blue sleeveless shirt, and a black techno-taffeta dress with its waist glamorously tied in a fat bow at the side.', collection_id: 4)

Card.create(image: 'http://localhost:3000/Dries_4.jpg', likes: 0, details: 'Fun pairs of pumps in diagonal stripes—yep, they appealed to all those ladies who have gone with the novelty of the white shoe and boot this past year. It was a super-clever step forward.', collection_id: 4)

Card.create(image: 'http://localhost:3000/Dries_5.jpg', likes: 0, details: 'No wonder Van Noten’s well-wishers were wreathed in smiles backstage. It was his best collection in quite a while.
